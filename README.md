# Official Repository of Plutonium Programming Langauge

Plutonium is a dynamically typed and lightweight programming language written in C++. Plutonium is compiled to bytecode and then interpreted by a virtual machine. This project has absolutely no external dependencies.

HOW TO COMPILE:
 Just compile the plutonium.cpp file and the executable obtained is the stand alone plutonium interpreter.
 If you are compiling on Windows then in plutonium.cpp change the first line to "#define BUILD_FOR_WINDOWS"
